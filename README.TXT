PROJECT TITLE: Pokemon
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: to create a game of Pokemon on the computer through
Java coding techniques
VERSION or DATE: May 2018
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: There are 2 versions of this game: the one with
graphics which is run by using the GraphicAppRunner, and the one without graphics which is
run by using Game. It is important to note that these games operate differently,
with different rules and a different structure of how to play.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1.) decide which version you want to play
	- graphics version: never ending loop of playing different trainers & Pokemon
	  with one Pokemon, and leveling that Pokemon up. There are no options to heal
	  as the Pokemon automatically heals between battles. The continue buttons are the pokeballs.
	  The game has critical hits at random moments for more excitement. Each type of pokemon
	  has 4 different attacks. 
	- non-graphics version: set route of trainers, gym leaders, and elite 4 to beat
	  the game. You must heal your pokemon in between battles if the pokemon has fainted. 
	  
2.) If you want to play the graphics version, run the GraphicAppRunner. If you would like
to play the non-graphics version, run the Game class.
3.) Have fun!
